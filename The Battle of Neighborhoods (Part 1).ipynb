As I am not sure exactly which part of Shanghai I will \\\nbe staying, I thought it is a good idea to take this capstone project as an apportunity to explore Shanghai in advance. \\\nIn this project, I will explore Shanghai (area where I will be settled down) following the criteria below: \n\n1. Find an area near to metro station\n2. Find an area near to hospital (health is very important during this pandemic!)\n\nFrom the above criteria, I should be able to narrow down the area I'd like to stay. \\\nThen I will explore the nearby area to look for Chinese restaurant for food. \n"

The same procedure will be repeated, \\\nwhereby I will impose hospital location to the SAME map that has the metro location. \\\n\nAs such, I will be able to look for a location that is close to a metro station and a hosptital."
